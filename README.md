# Docker Containers For fast.ai

This repository builds various docker images relevant to projects in [fastai](https://github.com/fastai/) on a recurring schedule [defined in this repo's workflow files](.github/workflows/). You must install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) before using this project.

These Docker containers are useful for production, testing and online services or to facilitate scenarios that require reproduceability and portability.  Some familiarity with Docker is assumed before using these containers.  For a gentle introduction to Docker, see [this blog post](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-docker-can-help-you-become-a-more-effective-data-scientist-7fc048ef91d5).

**For students taking the fast.ai courses, or for prototyping and development, fast.ai recommends using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) in your home directory, instead of these containers.** Please consult the appropriate repository for installation instructions.

# Projects

## fastai2
![Build fastai2 images](https://github.com/fastai/docker-containers/workflows/Build%20fastai2%20images/badge.svg)

Docker images for [fastai/fastai2](https://github.com/fastai/fastai2).  These images are built on top of [nvidia official CUDA images](https://hub.docker.com/r/nvidia/cuda/).  You can see the version of CUDA by looking at [the Dockerfile](fastai2-build/Dockerfile). **You must install [Nvidia-Docker](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker) to enable gpu compatibility with these containers.** Furthermore, fastai2 is installed with [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html), as using conda is the [recommended way](https://github.com/fastai/fastai2#installing) to install fastai2 dependencies.  You can see how these images are built in [.github/workflows/fastai2.yaml](.github/workflows/fastai2.yaml).

### fastai2 Images

- **[fastdotai/fastai2](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/fastdotai/fastai2)**: fastai2 and fastcore, with all of thier depenendencies.

    Pull this image:
    > `docker pull fastdotai/fastai2:latest`

- **[fastdotai/fastai2-dev](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/fastdotai/fastai2-dev)**:
has an editable install of fastai2 and fastcore and the latest release nbdev.  The editable installs for fastai and fastcore are located in `/home/docker-fastai2/fastai2` and `/home/docker-fastai2/fastcore`, respectively.

    > Pull this image: `docker pull fastdotai/fastai2-dev:latest`

Special thanks to [Giacomo Vianello](https://github.com/giacomov) for important contributions to this Docker image.

### fastai2 Usage

If you have a Nvdia GPU that is compatible with CUDA 10 or higher, you should [install Nvidia Docker](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker).  Afterwards, you will need to use the `--gpus` flag when running the container.  See the [usage](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker#usage) section for more details on the various arguments available.

### fastai2 Examples

- Run an interacive shell on CPUs (for example your laptop) on the latest version of fastai2:
    >  docker run -it fastdotai/fastai2 bash

- Run an interactive shell with `fastdotai/fastai2-dev` as the root user (with `--user root`), which can be helpful for installing various things.  Additionally, mount the current directory from your host file system to `/home/fastai-user` in the container (the `-v` flag) as well as make this the home directory (the `-w` flag) in the container.
   > docker run -it -v $PWD:/home/fastai-user -w /home/fastai-user --user root fastdotai/fastai2-dev bash

- Run an jupyter server on CPU on with an editable install
    > docker run -p 8888:8888 fastdotai/fastai2-dev jupyter notebook --ip=0.0.0.0 --no-browser --port=8888

- Test that your GPUS are visible to pytorch from within the docker container:
    > docker run --gpus 1 fastdotai/fastai2 python -c "import torch;print(torch.cuda.is_available())"

 - Run a jupyter server with all GPUs:
    > docker run --gpus all -p 8888:8888 fastdotai/fastai2 jupyter notebook --ip=0.0.0.0 --no-browser --port=8888

- Run a jupyter server with 2 GPUs on with an editable install:
    > docker run --gpus 2 -p 8888:8888 fastdotai/fastai2-dev jupyter notebook --ip=0.0.0.0 --no-browser --port=8888

- Run a jupyter server with 2 GPUs on with an editable install for version fastai `0.0.22`:
    > docker run --gpus 2 -p 8888:8888 fastdotai/fastai2-dev:0.0.22 jupyter notebook --ip=0.0.0.0 --no-browser --port=8888

## nbdev

![Build nbdev images](https://github.com/fastai/docker-containers/workflows/Build%20nbdev%20images/badge.svg)

Docker images for [nbdev](https://github.com/fastai/nbev).  These containers are built using [repo2docker](https://repo2docker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html), and come bundled working  Jupyter and JupyterLab. You can see how these images are built in [.github/workflows/nbdev.yaml](.github/workflows/nbdev.yaml).  The default entrypoint into these containers are Jupyter servers running on port `8888` with a user named `runner`, with a working directory of `/home/runner` in the container.

### nbdev Images

- **[fastdotai/nbdev](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/fastdotai/nbdev)**: an install of nbdev from the latest available version on GitHub.
    Pull this image:
    > `docker pull fastdotai/nbdev:latest`

- **[fastdotai/nbdev-dev](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/fastdotai/nbdev-dev)**:
has an editable install of nbdev.
    Pull this image:
    > `docker pull fastdotai/nbdev-dev:latest`

### nbdev Usage

There are two common ways to utilize this container:
   1. Serve a [Jupyter, JupyterLab or nteract](https://repo2docker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/howto/user_interface.html?highlight=jupyterlab#configure-the-user-interface) development environment.  After connecting with your browser to your running Jupyter instance you can:

        - Access JupyterLab: append `/lab` to the end of the URL like so:
            > `http(s)://<server:port>/lab`
        - Switch back to the classic notebook, add `/tree` to the URL like so:
            > `http(s)://<server:port>/tree`
        - You can launch nteract from within a user session by replacing /tree with /nteract at the end of a notebook serverâ€™s URL like so:
            > `http(s)://<server:port>/nteract`
   2. Run [nbdev utilities as part of your CI](https://github.com/fastai/nbdev#using-nbdev-as-part-of-your-ci) such as `nbdev_read_nbs`, `nbdev_clean_nbs`, `nbdev_diff_nbs`, `nbdev_test_nbs`.

### nbdev Examples

- Run a Jupyter server with an editable install of nbdev locally and mount your locally directory into the container.  We also bind the container port `8888` to `8888` on locahost so you can reach the Jupyter server:
    > docker run -p 8888:8888 -v $PWD:/home/runner/my_data fastdotai/nbdev-dev

- Run `nbdev_test_nbs` (in this case we are passing the -h flag to see help)
    > docker run fastdotai/nbdev nbdev_test_nbs -h

- Run `nbdev_test_nbs` on notebooks in your local directory that you mount into the container.  We set the working directory in the container to `/home/runner/my_data` where your local files are located.
    >  docker run -w /home/runner/my_data -v $PWD:/home/runner/my_data fastdotai/nbdev nbdev_test_nbs

# Miscellaneous Resources & Tips

- Save the state of a running container by first finding the Container ID of your running container with `docker ps`.  After you have located the relevant ID, you can use [docker commit](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/commit/) to save the state of the container for later use.

- Mount a local directory into your Docker image so that you can access files that are genearated when you exit your container with the `-v` flag.
